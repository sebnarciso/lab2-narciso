      <h2>Tokyo.</h2>
      <p>Tokyo was the first city I was able to visit in Japan.
        The <b>busy streets, the tall buildings, and the swarms of people</b> were
        all just so exciting to me. I loved seeing the different places the
        city had to offer. Just wandering  the streets was enough to make me
        feel so excited yet at home.I think another thing I really enjoyed about
        visiting Tokyo was the fact that <b>everything just seemed so well organized</b>.
        This was evident in how efficient their trains and public transport was.
        In addition, I found every person we encountered to be so polite,
        respectful, and considerate of others.</p>

        <h2>Gion District, Kyoto.</h2>
        <p>Gion is Kyoto's <b>most famous geisha district</b>, located around Shijo
        Avenue between Yasaka Shrine in the east and the Kamo River in the west.
        It is filled with shops, restaurants and ochaya (teahouses), where geiko
        (Kyoto dialect for geisha) and maiko (geiko apprentices) entertain.<br>
        Visiting Gion really painted the picture of the more cultural side of
        Japan. What I found so fascinating about the place was the fact that
        the area was both <b>very culturally-intact, yet also modern and urbanized</b>
        at the same time.</p>

        <h2>Navigating Japan.</h2>
        <p>When I visited Japan, my parents left it up to me to decide on our
          itenerary which involved <b>planning out each of our days in Japan,
          researching the different areas, laying out all of the directions,
          and choosing the hotels</b> we would be staying at.
          Though it was exhausting, it was completely rewarding once we arrived.
          On some days, my parents would even let me explore the cities
          we would visit by myself. The taste of being able to travel and
          explore on my own was so exciting to me. Hopefully after the
          pandemic, I get to visit Japan once again.</p>
